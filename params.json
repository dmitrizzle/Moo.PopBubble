Have `class=\"popBubble\"` and `data-pop-text` attribute in place within your links as well as `data-pop-form` attribute with an ID of your form (see demo.html)\r\n  2. You will also need to actually create the form within your html with the same ID as in the `data-pop-form` attribute in your link. *Note that currently the script and CSS in this plugin (or app, if you wish) only supports simple forms with a single button and a single text-input field*\r\n\r\n# Constructor\r\nYou can also dynamically create objects using `var myPop = new popBubble(element, options)` and call it via `myPop.pop(text)`, which adds a lot of power and is ridiculously easy to control.\r\n\r\nThe `options` can implement `styles: {}` object, where you can pass any CSS you wish, same way as if you'd pass it to any element using `MooTools.setStyles()` notation. It also has `offset: { x: 10, y: 20 }` that you can modify, as well as `text: text`, `button: text`, `action: [URL/JavaScript in text form]` and `form: [form element id]` that you could initialize with.\r\n\r\nIt really is easy to use and the best way to learn I find is by doing. So checkout demo.html for examples and explainations in comments.\r\n","google":"UA-73063986-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
